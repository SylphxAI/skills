# Enterprise Expansion Health Review

Use this skill to convert enterprise account health, expansion readiness, upsell, cross-sell, QBR, and renewal-risk questions into a concrete artifact with owners, gates, metrics, and recovery paths.

## Workflow

1. Identify current contract, product usage, success plan, value outcomes, unresolved risks, stakeholder map, champion status, white space, renewal date, and expansion trigger.
2. Read `references/enterprise-expansion-health-patterns.md`.
3. Classify account as unhealthy, stabilize-first, renewal-only, expansion-suspect, expansion-qualified, executive-alignment-needed, or procurement-ready.
4. Define health score evidence, expansion hypothesis, value proof, stakeholder plan, risk remediation, commercial owner, and customer communication path.
5. Produce expansion health review, state machine, decision table, event schema, account checklist, and next action plan.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not push expansion into accounts with unresolved incidents, adoption failure, weak value proof, or open trust issues.
- Do not confuse raw usage growth with business value, budget, stakeholder demand, or purchase readiness.
- Do not bypass customer success, support, or product signals when sales sees whitespace.
- Do not use QBRs as disguised sales pitches without customer outcome evidence.

## Output format

Account health context:
Audience / source of truth / risk boundary:

Expansion readiness plan:
| Area | Decision | Evidence | Risk | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Health risks, value proof, and stakeholder actions:
- <trigger> -> <policy, metric, edge case, support note>
```
