# Form UX Review

Use this skill to make forms easier, safer, and more trustworthy without hiding important terms.

## Workflow

1. Identify form goal, user intent, risk level, platform, data sensitivity, and completion metric.
2. Read `references/form-ux-systems.md`.
3. Map fields, steps, validation, error recovery, save/resume, accessibility, security, and support evidence.
4. Separate friction that protects users from friction that only reflects internal data needs.
5. Produce prioritized fixes with metrics and validation checks.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not remove fields needed for safety, legal, payment, privacy, or support without another control.
- Do not hide material terms behind prechecked boxes or vague copy.
- Do not optimize completion if it increases bad-fit leads, refunds, fraud, or support burden.

## Output format

```text
Form context:
Primary task:

Findings:
- P0 <issue> -> fix, validation, metric
- P1 <issue> -> fix, validation, metric

Field/step map:
- <field> -> why needed, validation, recovery

Instrumentation:
- <event/property>
```
