description: Design and audit release readiness exception boards covering unmet launch gates, blocked tests, risk acceptance, performance regressions, customer scope, mitigation owners, feature flags, rollback triggers, monitoring, support readiness, communication, approval authority, expiry, and post-release review. Use when a release is not fully ready and teams need a controlled exception instead of hidden risk. Do not use for routine release-train scheduling; use release-freeze-change-control-review instead.

# Release Readiness Exception Board Review

Use this skill to convert release readiness exception, launch gate waiver, release risk acceptance, feature flag mitigation, rollback trigger, support readiness, customer-scope exception, and approval board questions into a concrete artifact with owners, gates, metrics, and recovery paths.

## Workflow

1. Identify release scope, unmet gates, evidence gaps, customer impact, risk tier, mitigation options, decision authority, rollout containment, support/docs readiness, monitoring, rollback proof, and exception expiry.
2. Read `references/release-readiness-exception-board-patterns.md`.
3. Classify the situation as minor gate waiver, customer-limited release, compliance-sensitive exception, migration exception, store deadline exception, hotfix exception, feature-flagged rollout, or release freeze override.
4. Define exception intake, evidence requirements, decision table, approval authority, mitigation owners, rollout limits, rollback triggers, monitoring signals, support comms, expiry, and post-release review.
5. Produce exception board packet, state machine, decision table, event schema, exception register, readiness checklist, approval record, and post-release follow-up plan.

## Guardrails

- Do not let exceptions become a way to bypass normal release gates without evidence, owner, expiry, and review.
- Do not approve customer-impacting exceptions without support readiness, monitoring, rollback trigger, and communication plan.
- Do not confuse a feature flag with mitigation unless kill-switch ownership and customer impact are proven.
- Do not leave repeated exceptions as process debt; route them into gate, staffing, or architecture fixes.

## Output format

```text
Release exception context:
Audience / source of truth / risk boundary:

Exception board plan:
| Area | Decision | Evidence | Risk | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Unmet gates, risk acceptance, mitigations, approvals, monitoring, rollback, support, and expiry:
- <trigger> -> <policy, metric, edge case, support note>
```
