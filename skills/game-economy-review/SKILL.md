# Game Economy Review

Use this skill to make game economies sustainable, fair, and measurable.

## Workflow

1. Identify genre, session loop, audience, monetization model, and progression horizon.
2. Read `references/game-economy-patterns.md`.
3. Map sources, sinks, pacing, scarcity, offers, ads, events, refunds, and abuse vectors.
4. Check player trust, fairness, support recovery, and live-ops observability.
5. Produce economy risks, tuning levers, and event schema.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not recommend exploitative dark patterns, hidden odds, or coercive spend pressure.
- Separate ordinary refunds from abuse enforcement.
- Design for fun first; monetization should amplify value, not repair weak gameplay.
