# Promotion Campaign Review

Use this skill to turn promotions into measurable product systems instead of random discounts.

## Workflow

1. Identify campaign objective, audience, offer, channel, eligibility, and business constraint.
2. Read `references/promotion-campaign-patterns.md`.
3. Map placement, message, fulfillment, support, abuse controls, and measurement.
4. Check whether the campaign protects margin, trust, and long-term retention.
5. Produce launch checklist, experiment design, and rollback criteria.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not recommend fake scarcity, hidden terms, or coercive urgency.
- Do not run promotions without fulfillment/support readiness.
- Protect existing customer trust when offering discounts to new or returning users.
