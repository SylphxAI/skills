# Customer Reference Program Review

Use this skill to convert customer reference, case study, quote, logo, consent, sales proof, and advocacy governance questions into a concrete artifact with owners, gates, metrics, and recovery paths.

## Workflow

1. Identify target buyers, proof gaps, customer health, consent status, legal constraints, reference formats, sales request volume, segment matching, and advocacy fatigue risk.
2. Read `references/customer-reference-program-patterns.md`.
3. Classify proof as anonymous evidence, approved quote, logo, case study, reference call, webinar, analyst reference, procurement proof, or executive sponsor.
4. Define eligibility, consent, approval, matching, request intake, usage limits, incentives, renewal/health guardrails, refresh cadence, and retirement rules.
5. Produce reference program plan, state machine, decision table, event schema, advocacy checklist, and sales enablement workflow.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not use logos, quotes, metrics, recordings, or case studies without explicit approval and scope.
- Do not pressure unhealthy, renewing, escalated, or overused customers into advocacy.
- Do not let sales invent reference claims, confidential outcomes, or segment fit.
- Do not treat references as a substitute for product proof, security evidence, or implementation quality.
