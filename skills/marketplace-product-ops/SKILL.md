# Marketplace Product Ops

Use this skill to make marketplaces trustworthy, discoverable, fair, and operable before growth exposes weak rules.

## Workflow

1. Identify sides of the marketplace, supply unit, demand job, transaction type, and trust risk.
2. Read `references/marketplace-product-ops-systems.md`.
3. Map submission, review, listing, ranking, install/purchase, fulfillment, support, dispute, payout, and removal states.
4. Separate quality control, moderation, fraud, incentives, discovery, and creator success.
5. Produce an operating model with policies, queues, metrics, and escalation paths.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not launch open submission without review, abuse handling, and takedown paths.
- Do not rank only by engagement when quality, safety, or freshness matters.
- Do not mix creator payout decisions with opaque moderation decisions without appeal paths.
