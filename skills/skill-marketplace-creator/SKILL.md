# Skill Marketplace Creator

Use this skill to build a skill ecosystem that is useful, trustworthy, and distribution-ready.

## Workflow

1. Identify marketplace shape: repo-only, static catalog, API-backed registry, private enterprise registry, or full community marketplace.
2. Read `references/marketplace-playbook.md` for architecture and quality gates.
3. Define the skill supply strategy: internal flagship skills, curated third-party skills, community submissions, or agent-generated drafts.
4. Require validation before publication: schema, trigger quality, safety, license, examples, and evals.
5. Produce concrete repo structure, governance, launch channels, and next 48-hour actions.

## Marketplace principles

- Start repository-first. GitHub is the first marketplace, trust surface, and contribution flow.
- Curate before scaling. A small set of excellent skills beats a huge undifferentiated directory.
- Keep content attribution-safe. Distill original workflows; do not launder third-party writing.
- Make quality machine-checkable where possible.
- Separate skills from MCP tools: skills teach behavior; MCP servers provide capabilities.
