# Support Quality QA Review

Use this skill to convert a risky product, operations, trust, or marketplace question into a concrete artifact with owners, gates, metrics, and recovery paths.

## Workflow

1. Identify support channels, case types, risk classes, macros, escalation paths, QA owner, and customer outcomes.
2. Read `references/support-quality-patterns.md`.
3. Define QA dimensions: accuracy, empathy, policy, evidence, resolution, escalation, safety, revenue/trust impact, and documentation.
4. Design sampling, calibration, coaching, macro improvement, automation review, and product feedback loops.
5. Produce QA scorecard, review workflow, event schema, and improvement backlog.

## When not to use

- Do not use when the job belongs to `customer-support-operations` — Defer when the job matches customer-support-operations instead.
- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not score agents only on speed when correctness, fairness, or trust is at risk.
- Do not punish support for product gaps; route recurring causes back to product owners.
- Do not let AI/macros send high-impact policy, billing, or safety responses without QA gates.
- Protect customer privacy in QA examples and coaching artifacts.
