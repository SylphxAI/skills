# Community Governance Review

Use this skill to convert a community governance, norms, roles, moderation, escalation, transparency, incentives, events, and sustainability question into a concrete artifact with owners, gates, metrics, and recovery paths.

## Workflow

1. Identify community purpose, member segments, channels, roles, norms, risks, moderation owner, escalation path, and product feedback boundary.
2. Read `references/community-governance-patterns.md`.
3. Classify community type: support community, creator ecosystem, open-source community, game community, ambassador group, customer council, or marketplace community.
4. Define governance model, roles, norms, moderation ladder, transparency, event cadence, incentives, feedback routing, safety practices, and succession plan.
5. Produce governance plan, state machine, decision table, event schema, health checklist, and escalation policy.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not turn unpaid community leaders into hidden support staff without boundaries, recognition, and safety controls.
- Do not let community feedback become product policy without evidence, representation, and decision ownership.
- Do not ignore harassment, faction capture, spam, or misinformation because engagement metrics look high.
- Do not use incentives that reward low-quality posting, brigading, or fake advocacy.

## Output format

```text
Community context:
Purpose / roles / channels / health risk:

Community governance plan:
| Area | Decision | Evidence | Risk | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Norms, roles, and incentives:
- <item> -> <policy, metric, edge case, support note>

Escalation and sustainability policy:
- <trigger> -> <action, communication, owner>
```
