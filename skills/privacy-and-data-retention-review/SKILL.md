# Privacy And Data Retention Review

Use this skill to make data behavior intentional, explainable, and supportable.

## Workflow

1. Identify data categories, users, jurisdictions/channels, processing purposes, and storage systems.
2. Read `references/privacy-data-retention-patterns.md`.
3. Map collection, use, sharing, retention, deletion, export, backup, telemetry, and support access.
4. Compare product behavior with user-facing privacy/store disclosures.
5. Produce risks, retention schedule, and product changes.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- This is product/privacy design support, not legal advice.
- Do not invent compliance claims.
- Minimize data by purpose; do not collect because it might be useful someday.
