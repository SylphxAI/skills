# Customer Success Playbook Review

Use this skill to convert customer success playbook, account health, adoption, QBR, renewal, expansion, and risk-recovery questions into a concrete artifact with owners, gates, metrics, and recovery paths.

## Workflow

1. Identify segment, lifecycle stage, success outcome, account owner, usage milestones, support history, renewal timing, expansion potential, and health risks.
2. Read `references/customer-success-playbook-patterns.md`.
3. Classify playbook as onboarding, activation, adoption deepening, executive alignment, renewal save, expansion, risk recovery, champion change, QBR, or product-feedback loop.
4. Define triggers, entry/exit criteria, touchpoints, assets, owner roles, customer communication, product/support escalation, and success metrics.
5. Produce CS playbook, state machine, decision table, event schema, checklist, and operating cadence.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not make CSMs compensate forever for broken onboarding, product gaps, support defects, or unclear packaging.
- Do not use generic high-touch motions for all accounts; segment by value, complexity, risk, and growth potential.
- Do not treat health score as truth unless its signals map to outcomes and human review.
- Do not run QBRs or renewal saves without customer value evidence and unresolved-risk ownership.

## Output format

```text
Customer success context:
Audience / source of truth / risk boundary:

Success playbook plan:
| Area | Decision | Evidence | Risk | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Triggers, touchpoints, owners, and outcome metrics:
- <trigger> -> <policy, metric, edge case, support note>
```
