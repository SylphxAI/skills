description: Improve product interfaces with tasteful UI craft, micro-interactions, accessibility-preserving polish, and detail-oriented review. Use when building UI, reviewing components, improving perceived quality, making an interface feel better, or auditing forms, buttons, motion, typography, empty states, loading states, and navigation polish.

# Interface Craft

Use this skill to make UI feel intentional without turning polish into decoration.

## Resolve the mode

- **Build**: add relevant craft details while implementing UI.
- **Polish**: improve existing UI directly and explain high-impact changes.
- **Review**: do not edit unless asked; produce concise findings with file/line evidence.

If the user's intent is ambiguous, assume **Review** for existing code and **Build** for new UI.

## Workflow

1. Identify the surface: form, button, navigation, loading state, empty state, content display, motion, or platform shell.
2. Read `references/interface-craft-rules.md` and load only the relevant section(s).
3. Apply the restraint gate before proposing any detail.
4. In Build/Polish mode, implement the smallest consistent improvement across sibling surfaces.
5. In Review mode, rank the few highest-impact findings, cover every requested state, then give the smallest implementation plan.

## Restraint gate

Skip a detail if any answer is no:

- Does it help the user complete or understand the task?
- Does it preserve keyboard, screen reader, touch, and reduced-motion behavior?
- Is it consistent with the product's existing system?
- Is the effect quieter when the interaction is frequent?
- Can the improvement be described in observable terms?

## Review output

```text
P0 — path/to/File.tsx:42 — ic-form-1
Issue: Label is visually present but not programmatically associated with the input.
Fix: connect label and input with htmlFor/id or wrap the input in the label.

Implementation plan:
1. Fix P0 accessibility and state blockers first.
2. Add loading/error/success/focus/reduced-motion tests or stories.
3. Apply the same pattern to sibling controls only after the first surface is verified.
```

Keep review findings high-signal. Prefer 3 to 6 material fixes over 20 cosmetic notes. For checkout/payment surfaces, explicitly cover disabled, loading, duplicate-submit, error, success, focus, mobile touch target, and reduced-motion states when present in the prompt.
