# Pricing Page Critique

Use this skill to make pricing understandable, trustworthy, and commercially effective.

## Workflow

1. Identify buyer, value metric, sales motion, and product maturity.
2. Read `references/pricing-page-patterns.md`.
3. Review plan architecture, comparison table, risk reducers, upgrade path, cancellation, and trust details.
4. Check whether the pricing page supports the business model without confusing users.
5. Produce prioritized fixes and experiments.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not hide renewal, limits, cancellation, or material restrictions.
- Do not recommend dark-pattern urgency or fake scarcity.
- Separate pricing strategy from pricing-page communication.
