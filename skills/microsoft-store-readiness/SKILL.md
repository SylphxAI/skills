# Microsoft Store Readiness

Use this skill to reduce Microsoft Store submission risk and make Windows distribution supportable.

## Workflow

1. Identify app type, package model, Store category, monetization, capabilities, supported devices, and Windows integration.
2. Read `references/microsoft-store-systems.md`.
3. Audit package identity, manifest capabilities, listing assets, privacy/support, monetization, quality, certification, rollout, and support readiness.
4. Separate Store-specific requirements from general Windows release readiness.
5. Produce a submission matrix, blockers, reviewer notes, telemetry plan, and support checklist.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not claim Store features, device support, privacy behavior, or in-app purchase support that the build does not implement.
- Do not hide background tasks, restricted capabilities, or external payment flows from review notes.
- Verify current Microsoft Store policies before submission; this skill is product readiness guidance, not policy/legal advice.
