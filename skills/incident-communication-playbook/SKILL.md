# Incident Communication Playbook

Use this skill to communicate incidents clearly, quickly, and proportionately.

## Workflow

1. Identify incident type, user impact, blast radius, uncertainty, legal/privacy risk, and channels.
2. Read `references/incident-communication-patterns.md`.
3. Draft internal coordination, customer-facing updates, support macros, and post-incident follow-up.
4. Separate known facts, unknowns, actions, next update time, and user workaround.
5. Produce a communication timeline and approval/risk gates.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not speculate beyond verified facts.
- Do not hide material user impact.
- Route privacy/security/legal-sensitive incidents through the required review path.

## Output format

Timeline:
