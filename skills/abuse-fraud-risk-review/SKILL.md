# Abuse Fraud Risk Review

Use this skill to protect product integrity without punishing legitimate users unfairly.

## Workflow

1. Identify assets at risk, attacker incentives, abuse surfaces, and legitimate-user harm.
2. Read `references/abuse-fraud-risk-patterns.md`.
3. Map signals, controls, review ladder, support route, and recovery/appeal.
4. Separate prevention, detection, response, and learning.
5. Produce risk matrix and control plan.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not recommend silent irreversible punishment without evidence and appeal path.
- Do not collect excessive data for vague fraud goals.
- Balance false positives against abuse damage.

## Output format

Risk matrix:
