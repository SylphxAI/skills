# Mobile First UI Review

Use this skill to make mobile experiences feel native, fast, and easy to operate with one hand.

## Workflow

1. Identify the primary mobile job, screen type, and device constraints.
2. Read `references/mobile-ui-rules.md`.
3. Review the UI through hierarchy, reachability, input, feedback, platform chrome, accessibility, and failure states.
4. Separate critical blockers from polish opportunities.
5. Produce a concrete patch plan or review findings with rule IDs.

## When not to use

- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not optimize only for screenshots; optimize the lived touch flow.
- Preserve accessibility, reduced motion, dynamic type, safe areas, and keyboard behavior.
- Prefer removing friction before adding decoration.
