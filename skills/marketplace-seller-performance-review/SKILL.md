# Marketplace Seller Performance Review

Use this skill to convert marketplace seller performance, creator quality, seller health, ranking impact, warnings, coaching, suspension, appeal, and marketplace incentive questions into a concrete artifact with owners, gates, metrics, and recovery paths.

## Workflow

1. Identify seller type, category, lifecycle stage, buyer promise, performance signals, evidence quality, policy thresholds, ranking surfaces, intervention ladder, and appeal path.
2. Read `references/marketplace-seller-performance-patterns.md`.
3. Classify the situation as new seller onboarding, quality coaching, warning, ranking demotion, payout hold, badge eligibility, suspension, appeal, fraud review, or high-performing seller expansion.
4. Define performance dimensions, thresholds, confidence, explanations, interventions, appeal evidence, fairness monitoring, ranking impact, and improvement loop.
5. Produce seller performance plan, state machine, decision table, event schema, scoring checklist, intervention ladder, and fairness review.

## When not to use

- Do not use when the job belongs to `creator-ranking-quality-review` — Defer when the job matches creator-ranking-quality-review instead.
- Do not use for generic advice the base model already handles without this skill's specific artifact contract.

## Guardrails

- Do not use opaque performance scores to punish sellers without explanations, evidence, and appeal.
- Do not reward volume or revenue when disputes, refunds, policy violations, or support burden show buyer harm.
- Do not let new sellers be permanently buried by cold-start data gaps.
- Do not leak fraud or abuse signals while explaining performance actions.
